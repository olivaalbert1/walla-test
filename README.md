UI Testing using Playwright with JavaScript and the POM design pattern.
### **Project overview**

This project is a Playwright-based test automation framework designed to perform end-to-end testing on the UI. It employs the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to encapsulate page-specific logic and enhance test maintainability.

### **Technologies used**

* **Playwright:** A Node.js library to automate Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API.
* **JavaScript:** The primary programming language for test scripts.
* **Page Object Model (POM):** A design pattern that separates page-specific logic from test cases.
